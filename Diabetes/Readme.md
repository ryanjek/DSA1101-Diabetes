# Welcome to Diabetes Insight: Predictive Health Analytics

Diabetes is ranked as one of the most pervasive chronic diseases globally. The data used were collected through a survey conducted in the United States in 2015. It captured a diverse range of information related to diabetes, including demographic details, lifestyle factors, and crucial health indicators. The dataset has an equal 50-50 split of respondents with no diabetes and with either prediabetes or diabetes. This project will evaluate various classification methods aimed at identifying the most effective model by assessing its goodness of fit to predict diabetes status and detailing the rationale behind the choice of the best classifier.
